3. **Multi-stage Pipeline**:
   - Noise reduction using adaptive bilateral filtering
   - Detail enhancement with unsharp masking
   - Final adjustments with adaptive gamma correction

### Performance Optimizations

The application implements several advanced performance optimization techniques:

#### 1. Algorithmic Optimizations

- **Adaptive Window Sizing**: Dynamically adjusts window size based on image dimensions
- **Selective Entropy Calculation**: Skips entropy calculation for very large images
- **Image Downsampling**: Processes large images at reduced resolution, then upscales the result
- **LAB Color Space**: Uses perceptually uniform color space for better quality at lower processing cost

#### 2. Memory Management
- **Garbage Collection**: Explicit memory cleanup after processing steps
